A simple GitHub Actions script for building a Defold game.

The platform and architecture can be specified as inputs.
The default platform is js-web and the default architecture is wasm-web.

Hopefully this can make it easier for open source developers to publish to locations like GitHub Pages.

For example: https://github.com/prismglue/balatro-fx/blob/main/.github/workflows/defold-build-site.yml
