# GitHub Action for building Defold games with Bob
- PRs to extend/improve accepted.
- The platform and architecture can be specified as inputs.
- The default platform is js-web and the default architecture is wasm-web.

## Why use it?
 - Super fast and super easy to share your work for Defold competitions (and further!)
 - Build and publish to GitHub Pages after tagging a build (or whenever!)
 - Don't have to maintain your own Bob the Builder scripting (hit the ground running!)
 - Accepts PRs if you want to improve and extend (come one, come all!)

Example workflow for building a simple project and publishing to GitHub Pages: https://github.com/prismglue/balatro-fx/blob/main/.github/workflows/defold-build-site.yml
